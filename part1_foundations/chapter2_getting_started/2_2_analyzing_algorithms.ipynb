Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is knwn as **selection sort**. What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain? Why does it need to run for only the first $n-1$ elements, rather than for all $n$ elements? Give the best-case and worst-case running times of selection sort in $\\Theta$-notation."
