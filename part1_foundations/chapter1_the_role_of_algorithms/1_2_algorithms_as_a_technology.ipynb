    "Computational time and memory space are bounded resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different algorithms to solve the same problem can differ in their efficiency which is often much more significant than hardware and software differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency Example:\n",
    "1. **Insertion sort** takes time $c_1 n^2$ to sort $n$ items.\n",
    "2. **Merge sort** takes time $c_2 n \\log_2{n}$ to sort $n$ items.\n",
    "\n",
    "$c_1 < c_2$ typically. These factors can have far less impact on run time than the input size. Taking common factors out of each term $(c_1 n) \\cdot n$ and $(c_2 n) \\cdot \\log_2{n}$. When $n=1000, \\log_2{n} = 10$ and when $n=10^6, \\log_2{n} = 20.$ Insertion sort may run more quickly for small input sizes, but merge sort becomes more efficient as the input size gets large enough."
